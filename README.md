# ActivityStreams
A .NET implementation of the Activity Streams vocabulary in the form of classes that can be serialized using System.Text.Json

The specifications can be seen here: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/

These types are famously used in the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) implementation which is used in the Fediverse inclusing Mastodon.

## Goals
- [ ] Add classes for Core Types.
- [ ] Add extended classes for Activity Types.
- [ ] Add extended classes for Actor Types.
- [ ] Add extended classes for Object and Link Types.
- [ ] Add Unit Test project that validates the serialization of the classes.
- [ ] Look into the [Implementation Notes](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#notes) that hint at Ease-Of-Use-Scenarios.
